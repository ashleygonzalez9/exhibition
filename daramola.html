	<p> In this project we were put in groups and from the groups we were assigned an invention that was a big impact in the industrial revolution. My group was given the cotton gin. We each did different research about the invention then from there we had to do an anotated bibliography which was bascially about the reseach we each did. One of our group members did a sketch of what it looks like. The rest of the time we worked together to build the 3D Model of our invention.</p>
