	 <font size="6px"><p style="text-align:center;"> Our first project was called coding the past.For this project we had to do many different parts for each class for example we had to interview a person and from there we created a map of the important places they talked about in the interview. We also did an essay about a topic from the interview so for me I did the essay about The Rodney King Riots. We also did a subject self portrait using photoshop that represents the person that we interviewed. </p>

	 <font size="6px"><p stle="text-align:center;"> For the second project it was also a combined with both classes and the first part of it had to do with the industrial revolution and we had to do information about an invention from that time and build it and do research about it with my group. In my other class we did a pom and an art piece about an image of child labor which connects to child labor and we also did another poem and art piece about social media and a topic.
